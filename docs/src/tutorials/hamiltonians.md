# Hamiltonians

A Hamiltonian is basically a time-dependent matrix. The package currently offers two ways to construct a Hamiltonian object. Before introducing those constructors, let's discuss the unit of Hamiltonian first.

## Unit
From the Schrodinger equation
```math
  i\hbar \lvert \Phi \rangle = H \lvert \Phi \rangle
```
we know the Hamiltonian can be normalized by ``H / \hbar``. If we set ``h=1``, then what appears on the RHS of Schrodinger equation is ``2\pi H`` where ``H`` has the unit of frequency. We set this unit to the natural unit of superconducting qubits -- GHz.

## Construction
### Affine Operator

For `fs = [f1,f2,...,fn]` and `Ms = [M1,M2,...,Mn]` where each of the `fi` and
`Mi` are `Function`(or callable object) and `Matrix`, the following constructor:

```julia
function TypeHamiltonian(fs,Ms)
```
builds an time dependent Hamiltonian ``H = f_1(t)M_1 + f_2(t)M_2 + … + f_n(t)M_n``. The `Type` should be changed to a specific descriptor of the Hamiltonian. For example, a Hamiltonian consisted of dense matrices can be constructed with [`DenseHamiltonian`](@ref)
```julia-repl
julia> H = DenseHamiltonian([(s)->1-s, (s)->s], [σx, σz])
```
The `DenseHamiltonian` constructor creates a standard single qubit annealing Hamiltonian of the form ``H(s)=(1-s)σ_x+sσ_z``, whose default unit is GHz (``h=1``). Internally, this package always store the value of ``H/\hbar``. So any object created with default unit will be scaled by ``2π``. You can set the unit to ``ħ=1`` by using the keyword argument `unit`
```julia-repl
julia> H_ħ  = DenseHamiltonian([(s)->1-s, (s)->s], [σx, σz]; unit=:ħ)
```
(Setting `unit` to `:ħ` means the inputs of the constructor is already ``H/\hbar``.) To obtain the value of Hamiltonian at given `s` in consistent units, it is recommended to use function [`evaluate`](@ref)
```julia-repl
julia> evaluate(H, 0.5)
2×2 Array{Complex{Float64},2}:
  0.5+0.0im  -0.5+0.0im
 -0.5+0.0im  -0.5+0.0im
```
It always returns the Hamiltonian value in GHz.
Calling `H` directly like a `Function` will return numerical value of ``H/\hbar``
```julia-repl
julia> H(0.5) == 2π*(σx + σz)/2
true
```
There are two additional constructors: [`SparseHamiltonian`](@ref) and [`AdiabaticFrameHamiltonian`](@ref), which construct sparse Hamiltonians and Hamiltonians in adiabatic frame respectively.

### Interpolating
The second method is to construct the Hamiltonian by interpolating gridded values
```math
  [H(s_1), H(s_2), \ldots]
```
Internally, the package rely on [Interpolations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl) for fast interpolating. The syntax for constructing interpolation Hamiltonian object is
```julia
H_interp = InterpDenseHamiltonian(s_axis, H_list)
H_interp = InterpSparseHamiltonian(s_axis, H_list)
```
where `s_axis` and `H_list` are the grid points and corresponding Hamiltonian values. The constructors also take keyword argument `method`, `order` and `unit`. `method` and `order` specify the internal interpolation method. For dense Hamiltonians, both `BSpline` of order 0-3 and `Gridded` of order 0-1 are supported. For sparse Hamiltonians, only `Gridded` of order 0-1 is supported.

## Plotting
This package can also interact with [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) to provide convenient ways for visualizing the spectrum of any given Hamiltonians. For example
```julia
using Plots
plot(H, 0:0.01:1, 2)
```
will produce the following figure. The second argument `0:0.01:1` is the `x_axis` values and the third argument `2` is the number of levels to plot. The third argument can also be a list of levels.
